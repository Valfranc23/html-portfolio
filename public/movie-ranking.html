<h1>Valencia's Go-To Movies</h1>
<h2>Here's a look at my top 3 favorite films</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Interview with the Vampire</h3>
<p>I love this movie in part because Brad Pitt & Tom Cruise played their parts well. 
    The overall film adaptation of the book was also done well</p>

<h3>Harry Potter Film 5: Order of the Phoenix</h3>
<p>As another book-to-film adaptation, this one was one of the closest to the original book.</p>

<h3>Alice in Wonderland</h3>
<p>The world building in Disney's live action remake of this film is a lot of fun to look at.</p>
